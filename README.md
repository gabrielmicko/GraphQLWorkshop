### Task 5

#### Create database helper 🔍

```bash
open https://github.com/typicode/lowdb
```

All righty! 🚀 The new approach now is to replace the `.json` files with a database. To keep it as simple as possible, we are going to use `lowdb` which is a small JSON database for Node. This will be the first step on this journey. Your task will be to create a helper file which will handle the database operations, insert, delete, get etc. The path for it is here `src/store/helper.js`. Please do it according to the given documentation.

#### Seed

Important! Before you run the tests don't forget to seed the database with data. Run `yarn seed`. If you mess up the database at any time, just run this command again.

#### Hints:

- This task is a bit tricky. Feel free to ask. 🙋
- The functions are synchronous.
- Use the tests to test your functions.

#### Testing:

When you are done, please run this command:

```bash
yarn test
```

Or if you want to run the test on every change run this command:

```bash
yarn test:watch
```

#### Seed:

```bash
yarn seed
```

##### Good luck!
